 The pkg_resources module provides an API for Python libraries to
 access their resource files, and for extensible applications and
 frameworks to automatically discover plugins.  It also provides
 runtime support for using C extensions that are inside zipfile-format
 eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed
 modules or subpackages, and APIs for managing Python's current
 "working set" of active packages.

Description: Bean Scripting Framework to support scripting languages in Java
 Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
 scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
 objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write JSPs in
 languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class library. In
 addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or
 dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is
 achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines
 from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to
 these scripting language engines.
 .
 BSF supports these scripting languages:
  * Python (using Jython)
  * JavaScript (using rhino)
  * XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and Xerces)
  * BeanShell (using bsh) via its own bsf adapter
 .
 Support for Tcl, NetRexx is not available in this Debian
 package since Jacl, NetRexx (non-free) are not packaged.

 The Simple Logging Facade for Java (or SLF4J) is intended to serve as
 a simple facade for various logging APIs allowing to the end-user to
 plug in the desired implementation at deployment time. SLF4J also
 allows for a gradual migration path away from Apache Commons
 Logging (CL)
 .
 Logging API implementations can either choose to implement the SLF4J
 interfaces directly, e.g. logback or SimpleLogger. Alternatively, it
 is possible (and rather easy) to write SLF4J adapters for the given
 API implementation, e.g. Log4jLoggerAdapter or JDK14LoggerAdapter.

 HttpCore is a set of low level HTTP transport components that can be used

 .
  - blocking I/O model, based on the classic Java I/O;
  - non-blocking, event driven I/O model based on Java NIO.
 .
 The blocking I/O model may be more appropriate for data intensive, low
 latency scenarios, whereas the non-blocking model may be more appropriate
 for high latency scenarios where raw data throughput is less important
 than the ability to handle thousands of simultaneous HTTP connections in
 a resource efficient manner.

Description: Logging library for java
 log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of
 output targets.
 .
 It is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application
 binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in
 shipped code without incurring a high performance cost.
 .
 One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of hierarchical
 loggers. Using loggers it is possible to selectively control which log
 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
 .
 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,
 many output  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,
 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,
 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.
 .
 The format of the output can be defined using one of the various layout
 (or user defined layout) like: simple text, html, date, pattern defined and
 XML.

Description: Provide limited super user privileges to specific users
 Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root
 privileges to users and log root activity.  The basic philosophy is to give
 as few privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.
 .
 This version is built with minimal shared library dependencies, use the
 sudo-ldap package instead if you need LDAP support for sudoers.
