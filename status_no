Description: Wietse Venema's TCP wrapper utilities
 Wietse Venema's network logger, also known as TCPD or LOG_TCP.
 .
 These programs log the client host name of incoming telnet,
 ftp, rsh, rlogin, finger etc. requests.
 .
 Security options are:
  - access control per host, domain and/or service;
  - detection of host name spoofing or host address spoofing;
  - booby traps to implement an early-warning system.

Description: Bean Scripting Framework to support scripting languages in Java
 Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
 scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
 objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write JSPs in
 languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class library. In
 addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or
 dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is
 achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines
 from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to
 these scripting language engines.
 .
 BSF supports these scripting languages:
  * Python (using Jython)
  * JavaScript (using rhino)
  * XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and Xerces)
  * BeanShell (using bsh) via its own bsf adapter
 .
 Support for Tcl, NetRexx is not available in this Debian
 package since Jacl, NetRexx (non-free) are not packaged.

Description: Base of all Java packages
 This package must be installed in the system if a Java environment
 is desired. It covers useful information for Java users in
 Debian GNU/Linux, including:
  * The Java policy document which describes the layout of Java support in
    Debian and how Java packages should behave.
  * The Debian-Java-FAQ which provides information on the status of
    Java support in Debian, available compilers, virtual machines, Java
    programs and libraries as well as on legal issues.
  * Information on how to create dummy packages to fulfill java2
    requirements.

Description: set of low level HTTP transport components for Java
 HttpCore is a set of low level HTTP transport components that can be used
 to build custom client and server side HTTP services with a minimal
 footprint. HttpCore supports two I/O models:
 .
  - blocking I/O model, based on the classic Java I/O;
  - non-blocking, event driven I/O model based on Java NIO.
 .
 The blocking I/O model may be more appropriate for data intensive, low
 latency scenarios, whereas the non-blocking model may be more appropriate
 for high latency scenarios where raw data throughput is less important
 than the ability to handle thousands of simultaneous HTTP connections in
 a resource efficient manner.

Description: Logging library for java
 log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of
 output targets.
 .
 It is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application
 binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in
 shipped code without incurring a high performance cost.
 .
 One of the distinctive features of log4j is the notion of hierarchical
 loggers. Using loggers it is possible to selectively control which log
 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
 .
 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,
 many output  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,
 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,
 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.
 .
 The format of the output can be defined using one of the various layout
 (or user defined layout) like: simple text, html, date, pattern defined and
 XML.

  * Simple API for XML (SAX) 2.0.2
  * Java APIs for XML Processing (JAXP) 1.3.04
  * Transformation API for XML (TrAX) 1.3.04
  * Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load and Save
  * JSR 206 Java API for XML Processing 1.3
 .
 These classes are also used in Sun's reference implementation. A GPL'ed
 implementation of these APIs can be found in the libgnujaxp-java package.

Description: Java Library to generate PDF on the Fly
 iText is a library that allows you to generate PDF files on the fly.
 The iText classes are very useful for people who need to generate read-only,
 platform independent documents containing text, lists, tables and images.
 The library is especially useful in combination with Java(TM)
 technology-based Servlets: The look and feel of HTML is browser dependent;
 with iText and PDF you can control exactly how your servlet's output will look.
 iText requires JDK 1.2. It's available for free under a multiple license:
 MPL and LGPL.
